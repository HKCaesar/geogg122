It allows many users to share a powerful machine and all the available resources, each user running their own processes simultaneously. This true multi-tasking aspect of UNIX allows a far greater flexibility than is possible with other operating systems, even more recent multi-tasking versions of popular PC operating systems (note that the linux is simply a \u2018flavour\u2019 of UNIX & that the Mac operating system OS-X has a good deal of UNIX system within it). The advantages of a truly flexible multi-tasking operating system has been demonstrated with the popularity of UNIX in the scientific, engineering and financial communities, along with the rise of Linux and OS-X.\n",

A key aspect of this has always been the idea of remote graphical user interfaces via X11, which allows a user to run and visualise processes on different Unix machines. You are not limited to accessing the computer you are sat in front of, but can easily make wider use of local or external resources. You will find this useful as you can log on to the UCL Geography Unix computers from outside UCL (from pretty well any other operating system) and (with appropriate X11 software such as cygwin or exceed, if you are working from a Windows computer, or directly from any Unix/linux computer os OS-X machine) run windowing sessions the same as if you were physically at the UCL computer (given sufficient bandwidth)."

      "Workstations that run UNIX are not like the way most people use PCs running Windows... At any time of the day or night a UNIX machine is running literally hundreds of processes simultaneously: Some are long-term user processes (such as research experiments) placed at low priority to avoid affecting other users, which may run for weeks, but most are concerned with the second by second activities of maintaining the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physically, the network consists of 'wires' (ethernet cables, phone lines, fibre-optic cables etc.) or wireless connections (locally and externally) running between computers both at local and remote sites. At the local level (within a University Dept. for example) the wires literally connect every machine to every other, either in a loop, or in a star-like arrangement with machines linked around central communications hubs. Such arrangements of connections, machines and attached peripheral devices is known as a Local Area Network or LAN. Larger arrangements of connections, for instance between departments in a university rather than individual computers, are known as Wide Area Networks or WANs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is through this ability to transparently network computers together that UNIX really gains its power. Very often the data a user processes on one computer is actually stored on another (a paradigm that has (indirectly) led to the development of the Internet and World Wide Web). Similarly it is commonplace to process data on one machine whilst physically sitting in quite a different location (even on a different continent!). The limiting idea of the machine that you are sitting in front of being the machine you are using for processing (as in the PC-based computing environment) is very much obsolete in the case of UNIX computing. Using the network, it is also possible to break large processes into a number of smaller jobs and distribute them across multiple machines simultaneously, thereby reducing execution times dramatically. In a properly set-up UNIX LAN network, the storage of a users data on a remote machine, or their working on a remote machine should be a relatively transparent operation. Such concepts of networking are not confined to UNIX machines, although UNIX (in all its varieties) is far and away the most common from of operating system used for wide area networking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because a UNIX machine never stops processing, the are **never switched off** by anyone other than the system manager or a relevant member of staff. Simply switching off as you might with a PC can cause irreparable damage to a UNIX machine and/or the data stored on it - remember, your data/project could be on the disk you just killed, so don\u2019t do it! If you think that there is something wrong with a machine, do not attempt to fix it yourself: call or email the system manager or ask a knowledgeable person for advice. Under no circumstances should you attempt to reboot a workstation yourself, as unless shut down properly damage to data, both yours and that of others is likely to result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many workstations you will come across have a simple power-saving device: the screen turns itself off if the keyboard hasn\u2019t been used for a few minutes. To turn the screen back on, simply press a key on the keyboard such as shift, ctrl or the space bar. Often the monitor will have been turned off by the last user to save power (and to stop the lab heating up!) - in most cases, the monitors have a switch or button located on the lower right front of the monitor. If the monitor is on, a small green LED will light up. This is the only switch you should ever touch on the workstations. If it\u2019s not on the front of the monitor, please leave it alone."
