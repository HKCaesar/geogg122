Introduction to GeogG122 Scientific Computing
=============================================

Purpose of this course
======================
This course, GeogG122 Scientific Computing, is a term 1 MSc module worth 15 credits (25% of the term 1 credits) that aims to:

* impart an understanding of scientific computing
* give students a grounding in the basic principles of algorithm development and program construction
* to introduce principles of computer-based image analysis and model development

It is open to students from a number of `MSc courses <http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/admissions-and-teaching/postgraduates>`_  run by the `Department of Geography <http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk>`_ `UCL <www.ucl.ac.uk>`_, but the material should be of wider value to others wishing to make use of scientific computing.

The module will cover:

* Introduction to programming (algorithms, data structures, control structures, I/O, languages and pseudocode)
* Introduction to linux environment (login, shell, file systems) and hardware
* Compilation and debugging
* Computing for image analysis (with reference to software such as ENVI/IDL)
* Computing in Python
* Computing for environmental modelling
* Data visualisation for scientific applications
