      "\n",
      "This course, GeogG122 Scientific Computing, is a term 1 MSc module worth 15 credits (25% of the term 1 credits) that aims to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* impart an understanding of scientific computing\n",
      "* give students a grounding in the basic principles of algorithm development and program construction\n",
      "* to introduce principles of computer-based image analysis and model development\n",
      "\n",
      "It is open to students from a number of [MSc courses](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/admissions-and-teaching/postgraduates)  run by the [Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk) [UCL](www.ucl.ac.uk), but the material should be of wider value to others wishing to make use of scientific computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The module will cover:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Introduction to programming (algorithms, data structures, control structures, I/O, languages and pseudocode)\n",
      "* Introduction to linux environment (login, shell, file systems) and hardware\n",
      "* Compilation and debugging\n",
      "* Computing for image analysis (with reference to software such as ENVI/IDL)\n",
      "* Computing in Python\n",
      "* Computing for environmental modelling\n",
      "* Data visualisation for scientific applications\n",
      "\n",
      "## Learning Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the module, students should:\n",
      "\n",
      "* have a working knowledge of linux / unix operating systems and have the knowledge and confidence to obtain, compile and install commonly available scientific software packages\n",
      "* have an understanding of algorithm development and be able to use widely used scientific computing software to manipulate datasets and accomplish analytical tasks\n",
      "* have an understanding of the technical issues specific to image-based analysis, model implementation and scientific visualisation\n",
      "\n",
      "## Timetable\n",
      "\n",
      "The course takes place over 10 weeks in term 1, on Wednesdays usually from 10:00 to 13:00 (09:00-13:00 in t5he first two sessions) in the Geography Department Unix Computing Lab (PB110) in the [Pearson Building, UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/efd/roombooking/building-location/?id=003). Classes take place from the second week of term to the final week of term, other than Reading week.
