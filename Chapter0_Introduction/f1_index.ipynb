      "   The aim of this Chapter is to introduce you to some of the fundamental concepts in Python. Mainly, this is based around fundamental data types in Python (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` etc.) and ways to group them (`tuple`, `list` and `dict`).  We then learn about how to loop over groups of things, which gives us control to iterate some process. We need to spend a little time on strings, as you will likely to quite a bit of string processing in Scientific Computing (e.g. reading/writing data to/from ASCII text files). Although some of the examples we use are very simple to explain a concept, the more developed ones should be directly applicable to the sort of programming you are likely to need to do. A set of exercises is developed throughout the chapter, with worked answers available to you once you have had a go yourself. In addition, a more advanced section of the chapter is available, that goes into some more detail and complications. This too has a set of exercises with worked examples.  \n",

      "\n",
      "This course, GeogG122 Scientific Computing, is a term 1 MSc module worth 15 credits (25% of the term 1 credits) that aims to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* impart an understanding of scientific computing\n",
      "* give students a grounding in the basic principles of algorithm development and program construction\n",
      "* to introduce principles of computer-based image analysis and model development\n",
      "\n",
      "It is open to students from a number of [MSc courses](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/admissions-and-teaching/postgraduates)  run by the [Department of Geography](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk) [UCL](www.ucl.ac.uk), but the material should be of wider value to others wishing to make use of scientific computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The module will cover:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Introduction to programming (algorithms, data structures, control structures, I/O, languages and pseudocode)\n",
      "* Introduction to linux environment (login, shell, file systems) and hardware\n",
      "* Compilation and debugging\n",
      "* Computing for image analysis (with reference to software such as ENVI/IDL)\n",
      "* Computing in Python\n",
      "* Computing for environmental modelling\n",
      "* Data visualisation for scientific applications\n",

      "\n",
      "At the end of the module, students should:\n",
      "\n",
      "* have a working knowledge of linux / unix operating systems and have the knowledge and confidence to obtain, compile and install commonly available scientific software packages\n",
      "* have an understanding of algorithm development and be able to use widely used scientific computing software to manipulate datasets and accomplish analytical tasks\n",
