-  2.0 Python 101  
 The aim of this Chapter is to introduce you to some of the fundamental concepts in Python. Mainly, this is based around fundamental data types in Python (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` etc.) and ways to group them (`tuple`, `list` and `dict`).  We then learn about how to loop over groups of things, which gives us control to iterate some process. We need to spend a little time on strings, as you will likely to quite a bit of string processing in Scientific Computing (e.g. reading/writing data to/from ASCII text files). Although some of the examples we use are very simple to explain a concept, the more developed ones should be directly applicable to the sort of programming you are likely to need to do. A set of exercises is developed throughout the chapter, with worked answers available to you once you have had a go yourself. In addition, a more advanced section of the chapter is available, that goes into some more detail and complkications. This too has a set of exercises with worked examples.

- 3.0 Plotting and Numerical Python
      
  In this session, we will introduce and use some packages that you will commonly use in scientific programming.
      
  These are: 
      
  [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/): NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python   
  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/): Python 2D plotting library   
    
  We will also introduce some additional programming concepts, and set an exercise that you can do and get feedback on.

- 4.0 Geospatial data

  In this session, we will learn to use some geospatial tools using GDAL in Python. A good set of working notes on how to use GDAL has been developed that you will find useful for background reading.
