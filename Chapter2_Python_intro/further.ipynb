It is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty\u2019s grandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers.  Whereupon the emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their eggs.  The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.  These civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire.  It is computed that eleven thousand persons have at several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end.  Many hundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy: but the books of the Big-endians have been long forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding employments.\"``\n",

      "At present, probably most computers you use will be little-endian (the 'Intel convention' as it has come to be known), but you may also come across data stored in big-endian (so-called 'Motorola convention') format. \n",

      "Endianness is mainly implemented at the byte level, so if you are considering a signle byte, which 'end you open the egg' has no consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "For longer number representations though (e.g. a 2-byte or 4-byte integer) it can have significant consequences, and you need to be aware of the endianness of data that you might try to be reading. Many file formats will explicitly store the endinaness that data were written in, so a correct interpretation will be handled by low level reading routines. But, if you get binary data that are of more than one byte that look rather odd when you display them, one possible reason is that you have assumed a different endinaness to what the data were written in.\n"
