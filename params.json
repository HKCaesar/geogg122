Mainly, this is based around fundamental data types in Python (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` etc.) and ways to group them (`tuple`, `list` and `dict`).  We then learn about how to loop over groups of things, which gives us control to iterate some process. We need to spend a little time on strings, as you will likely to quite a bit of string processing in Scientific Computing (e.g. reading/writing data to/from ASCII text files). Although some of the examples we use are very simple to explain a concept, the more developed ones should be directly applicable to the sort of programming you are likely to need to do. A set of exercises is developed throughout the chapter, with worked answers available to you once you have had a go yourself. In addition, a more advanced section of the chapter is available, that goes into some more detail and complkications. This too has a set of exercises with worked examples.  \r\n\r\n  [Course Notes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter2_Python_intro/python101.ipynb)  \r\n  [Answers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter2_Python_intro/main_answers.ipynb)  \r\n  [Advanced](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter2_Python_intro/advanced.ipynb)  \r\n  [Advanced Answers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter2_Python_intro/advanced_answers.ipynb)  \r\n \r\n \r\n **3.0 Plotting and Numerical Python**\r\n      \r\n  In this session, we will introduce and use some packages that you will commonly use in scientific programming.\r\n      \r\n  These are: \r\n      \r\n  [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/): NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python   \r\n  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/): Python 2D plotting library   \r\n    \r\n  We will also introduce some additional programming concepts, and set an exercise that you can do and get feedback on.   \r\n      \r\n  [Course Notes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter3_Scientific_Numerical_Python/Scientific_Numerical_Python.ipynb)  \r\n  [Answers](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter3_Scientific_Numerical_Python/answers.ipynb)  \r\n  [Advanced](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/profLewis/geogg122/master/Chapter3_Scientific_Numerical_Python/advanced.ipynb)  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
